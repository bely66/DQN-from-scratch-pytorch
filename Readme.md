# Inroduction
This repo aims at coding from scratch the DQN model published by DeepMind at their original paper [Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/docs/dqn.pdf) in PyTorch.





## Create Conda Environment
conda create -n dqn python=3.8

## Todos
- [x] Benchmark the baseline model using StableBaseline 3
- [x] Benchmark the baseline model using Karpathy MLP
- [ ] Write the DQN model
- [ ] Write the DQN model with experience replay
- [ ] Train the model on 1 atari game
- [ ] Visualize the model performance in 1 ataari game
